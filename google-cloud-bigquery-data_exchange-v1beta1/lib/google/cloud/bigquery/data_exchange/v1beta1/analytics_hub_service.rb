          # The AnalyticsHubService API facilitates data sharing within and across
          # organizations. It allows data providers to publish Listings --- a
          # discoverable and searchable SKU representing a dataset. Data consumers can
          # subscribe to Listings. Upon subscription, AnalyticsHub provisions a "Linked
          # Datasets" surfacing the data in the consumer's project.
          #
          # To load this service and instantiate a client:
          #
          #     require "google/cloud/bigquery/data_exchange/v1beta1/analytics_hub_service"
          #     client = ::Google::Cloud::Bigquery::DataExchange::V1beta1::AnalyticsHubService::Client.new
          #
